## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2025-05-24

### Removed

- Removed `Clear-ZeroedEnumPropertyValue` as it was moved and implemented
  the `Get-DscProperty` command in the _DscResource.Common_ module.

### Added

- Wiki
  - How to use this base class. Fixes [#5](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Base/issues/5)
  and [#19](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Base/issues/19).
  - Add WikiContent to release assets.

### Changed

- `ResourceBase`
  - Refactor `GetDesiredState` method to handle zeroed enum values using
    `Get-DscProperty` when the property `FeatureOptionalEnums` is set to
    `$true`.
  - Remove calls to `Assert()` and `Normalize()` in `Test()` and `Set()` fixes [#35](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Base/issues/35).

### Fixed

- build.yaml
  - Add `Generate_Wiki_Content`, `Generate_Wiki_Sidebar`, `Clean_Markdown_Metadata`
docs tasks. Fixes [#32](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Base/issues/32).
- `ResourceBase`
  - Add check for properties not being `$null` fixes [#30](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Base/issues/30).
  - Comment typo's.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-03-15

### Added

- `ResourceBase`
  - Added a new method `NormalizeProperties` that can be overridden in a
    derived class to provide custom normalization logic. This method can
    be used to normalize the properties of a desired state prior to the
    methods `AssertProperties`, `GetCurrentState`, and `Modify` being called.
    Default there is no normalization of properties. Fixes [issue #27](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Base/issues/27).

## [1.2.1] - 2025-02-03

### Changed

- `Clear-ZeroedEnumPropertyValue`
  - Fixed enum type check.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-02-02

### Added

- `ResourceBase`
  - Add optional feature flag to handle using Enums as optional properties.
    This requires setting the starting value of the Enum to 1 so it is
    initialized as 0. Fixes [Issue #22](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Base/issues/22).

    To use, set `$this.FeatureOptionalEnums = $true` in your class constructor.
- `Clear-ZeroedEnumPropertyValue`
  - Added private function to remove enums with a zero value from a hashtable.

### Changed

- `ResourceBase`
  - Add feature flag to allow use of enums on optional properties.
- `RequiredModules`
  - Add PlatyPS
- `Resolve-Dependency`
  - Add latest config
- `build.yaml`
  - Move docs to own task
  - Remove `VersionedOutputDirectory` as default value is `True`
- `build.ps1`
  - Update from Sampler
- `Resolve-Dependency.ps1`
  - Update from Sampler

### Fixed

- `Get-LocalizedDataRecursive`
  - Switch `throw` to use `TerminatingError` [issue #16](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Base/issues/16)

## [1.1.2] - 2024-08-17

### Fixed

  - Move strings to localized versions ([issue #7](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Base/issues/7)).
  - Fix various formatting issues

## [1.1.0] - 2023-02-26

### Added
